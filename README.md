## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression Summary](Images/linear_regression_summary.png)

1) According to the linear regression summary above, we can look at the Pr(>|t|) values to determine which variables are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance. In this particular case, vehicle_length and ground_clearance have Pr(>|t|) values less than 0.05. Therefore, these two variables are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
2) The p-value of the summary shows that there is a significant relationship between independent and dependent variables, therefore the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.
3) The R-squared value determines the strength of the relationship between the linear model and the dependent variable, mpg of MechaCar prototypes. The summary indicates that the R-squared value is 0.7149, which is a strong correlation. Therefore, this linear model effectively predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
